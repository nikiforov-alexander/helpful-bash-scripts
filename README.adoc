== Main File Included Everywhere

Main file that is included everywhere is {helpful_bash_funcs_sh}.
In this file a lot of very simple, yet needed functions are defined:

* `cf` : enhanced cat file 
* `em` : enhanced echo 
* `_` : bash decorator 
* `crdir` : enhanced mkdir
* `crdir_if_not_exist` : enhanced mkdir, check is dir exists
* `crdir_if_exist_overwrite` : enhanced mkdir, overwrites dir if exists
* `ss_and_vim` : creates alias `vv` that after you type 
    `ss` will open script file
* colorful functions: make output colorful
    ** `gray`
    ** `red`
    ** `green`
    ** `blue`
    ** `resetcolor`
* `check_if_it_exists` : checks if file exists
* `set_var` : enhanced set of variabe
* `echo_var` : echoes variable by name 
* `cd` : enhanced `cd` function, used in scripts
* `exit` : enhanced `exit` function, when used in scripts, prints more info

== Aliases

File with Bash aliases {aliases_sh} has collection of very simple but useful 
commands,
and is used to run many of the scripts defined here. It may be better to
add all of them to `$PATH` but I liked it this way.

To follow naming convention of `.bash_aliases` I usually create a link 
in `$HOME` directory to this file:

```bash
ln -s /path/to/aliases.sh ~/.bash_aliases
```

In the file itself I use `set_alias` function to keep track of aliases I've
created. It might seem as overkill, but I like verbosity. Although for now
`set_alias` function does not do much.

Later I plan to include description for alias may be.

== Git Scripts

Collection of helpful Git scripts. For now just one, hopefully
will be more

=== Add Untracked Files To .gitignore

The script {add_files_to_gitignore_sh} is script that is used
to add all 'Untracked' files to `.gitignore`. 

If you are not in top-level directory, script will show
it to you and ask to go there and run `git status`
again to make sure you want put those files to `.gitignore`.

Script creates `.gitignore` if it does not exist.

=== Nice listing script

I added {ls_with_pwd} script, that prints files nicely.

The major difference that now it also prints `PWD`
before actual `$` symbol.

Also it colors file grouping them by first letter.

Here is nice image:
